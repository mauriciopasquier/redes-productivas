/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or vendor/assets/stylesheets of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the top of the
 * compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.
 *
 * Bootstrap
 * =========
 *
 * Import "bootstrap" in your SCSS file of choice to get all of Bootstrap's
 * styles, mixins and variables! We recommend against using //= require
 * directives, since none of your other stylesheets will be able to use the
 * awesome mixins that Bootstrap has defined:
 *
 *   @import "bootstrap";
 *
 * As per the Bootstrap project we don't include the responsive styles by
 * default. @import "bootstrap-responsive"; to get them.
 *
 *= require_self
 *= require bootstrap_and_overrides
 *= require_tree .
